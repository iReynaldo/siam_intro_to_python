# SIAM Intro to Python

Presentation for the University of Connecticut SIAM Workshop as a brief introduction to the modules used in data analytics and machine learning in Python.

The material assumes ability to use the command line / terminal. Some things may require you to use the terminal, but in some cases you may use a graphical user interface instead.

#### Further Topics in Python

The slides for "Further Topics in Python" is based around tutorials, guides, and other slides I found online. I think they should be very useful to helping you get onboard with using Python as your data analytics weapon on choice!

> **Note:** _Lecture-4-Matplotlib.ipynb_ in my repository is a slightly modified version of the one by [Robert Johansson](https://github.com/jrjohansson), who created an exceptional [lecture series in jupyter notebooks for python in data science](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures).
